### A text-to-speech chat reader for Twitch

#### To Do

This is a VERY basic app right now and still needs quite a few things.  

. Make it look like not-poo.
. Refactor out coupling with settings and Speech.
. Create modular plug-in system. (you can add your own modules)
. Follower visual alert for apps like OBS (basically output a file for OBS to read)
. Add more settings so you don't have to edit config files to change stuff.
. Extract speech text to settings file/config menu.
. Configurable timers to remind people to "hit that follow button."
. Chat overlay for games - output the chat directly onto your game.

### Bugs

. Sometimes it just won't restart. I think that's because a thread is left dangling. Need to find and fix that.
